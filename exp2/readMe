1- find the official installation guide
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK569861/
2- select the proper installation method, for Linux O.S without super user right
Source tarball
https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/
wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/2.2.31/ncbi-blast-2.2.31+-src.tar.gz .
3- compile and build
tar xzvf ncbi-blast-2.2.31+-src.tar.gz
cd ncbi-blast-2.2.31+-src/c++
./configure
	compiling a library/tool from source code is a headache
	time consuming
	check hundreds dependencies
	advanced configuration required
		compiler selection, gnu, intel
		cpu architecture, amd, intel, gpu
		library specific setups such as dependencies, mpi, openmp, 
	crucial performance tuning 
	not portable nor reproducable, specific to your hpc cluster
cd ReleaseMT/build
make all_r
takes around 1h
4- set PATH and test cli


Follow the standard approach for the workload
...input
 -all input files required for a run
...output
 -all output files required for a run
...logs
 -all log files obtained during the run
...scripts
 -all bash script files required for a run
...sw
 -all customized sw that we compiled & built
...test.slurm
 -slurm batch script
 
 Problems
 configuration in bash script
not easy to follow sequentially created output files in order
if job fails, execute everything
customize sw/tool is headache, not portable nor reproducable
assigning equal number of cpu & amount of memory & time limit for each task is must and not practical
how to increase number of tasks
 or insert another task between existing ones
   please consider the input output file flow throughout the sequential tasks
how to scale out a new proteins
 create a new folder following the same schema
  what happened if you run for 20K protein
  how to know which protein failed and why? 
  how to debug and solve the issue? 
  if a change is required, for example, sw release or parameter, how to manage and archive new results? start over from the beginning?
